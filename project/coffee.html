            <h1>Spiced Mocha Latte</h1>
            <p>This latte is made with rich espresso, creamy milk, and a blend of warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. 
                The chocolatey flavor comes from high-quality cocoa powder, and the sweetness is balanced out with a touch of maple syrup. 
                Our cocoa powder is sourced from a fair trade cooperative in Ghana that ensures ethical labor practices and sustainable 
                farming methods.</p>
            <h1>Honey Lavender Latte</h1>
            <p>This latte is a delicate and floral twist on the classic latte. We use a shot of espresso and velvety steamed milk, 
                flavored with a homemade honey-lavender syrup. The honey is sourced from a local apiary that prioritizes natural 
                beekeeping practices, and the lavender is grown organically on a family-owned farm in France.</p>
            <h1>Iced Caramel Macchiato</h1>
            <p>This refreshing iced coffee is perfect for warmer weather. We start with a double shot of espresso, pour it over ice, 
                and add a generous drizzle of creamy caramel sauce. The milk is lightly frothed and added on top, creating the classic 
                "macchiato" layered effect. Our caramel sauce is made in-house with organic sugar and local cream from a nearby dairy.</p>
